# CLI Proxy API

English | [中文](README_CN.md)

A proxy server that provides OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Codex compatible API interfaces for CLI.

It now also supports OpenAI Codex (GPT models) and Claude Code via OAuth.

So you can use local or multi-account CLI access with OpenAI(include Responses)/Gemini/Claude-compatible clients and SDKs.

## Overview

- OpenAI/Gemini/Claude compatible API endpoints for CLI models
- OpenAI Codex support (GPT models) via OAuth login
- Claude Code support via OAuth login
- Qwen Code support via OAuth login
- iFlow support via OAuth login
- Streaming and non-streaming responses
- Function calling/tools support
- Multimodal input support (text and images)
- Multiple accounts with round-robin load balancing (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Qwen and iFlow)
- Simple CLI authentication flows (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Qwen and iFlow)
- Generative Language API Key support
- AI Studio Build multi-account load balancing
- Gemini CLI multi-account load balancing
- Claude Code multi-account load balancing
- Qwen Code multi-account load balancing
- iFlow multi-account load balancing
- OpenAI Codex multi-account load balancing
- OpenAI-compatible upstream providers via config (e.g., OpenRouter)
- Reusable Go SDK for embedding the proxy (see `docs/sdk-usage.md`)
